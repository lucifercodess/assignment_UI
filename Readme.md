Do let me know Sir if any changes needed and if you have any advice for me.
please feel free to modify
Only used bootstrap and html css , therefore could have been better
In the tyres and the reviews where i have passed static values and added them one by one, this is bad practice and should be avoided if you have dynamic data dn map function in javascript could have been used!
thankyou!!
